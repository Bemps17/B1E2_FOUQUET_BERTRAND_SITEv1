                <h2>Connecting People & Places</h2>
                <br><br>
                <p>
            Though exploration is often associated with places, at its very heart, it’s about the people. For
                nearly 70 years, the person-to-person experience has been at the very core of Liberty Travel’s
                mission. It’s what we’ve always done and it’s what we do now. Real people helping real people.

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <br><br>
              <p>In 1951 we opened our doors in New York City, with a clear focus on customer service as we offered the
                very first complete vacation package. Soon after, we were helping Americans discover the world with
                international trips. Today, from being a part of one of the world’s largest travel companies, Flight
                Centre Travel Group to supporting small travel businesses with Independent by Liberty Travel,
                our commitment to creating connections, providing one-on-one service, and crafting the perfect
                vacation remains stronger than ever.</p>  
                <br><br>
                <h2> Our Mission</h2>
                <br><br>
              <p>For 70 years, the person-to-person experience has been at the very core of <span>Dream</span>
                Destination
                Travel’s mission. It's what we've always done, and now it’s more important than ever. To ensure your
                next vacation is as priceless as your last, we are committed to offering you guidance, value, peace of
                mind, and service. It’s a reminder that when you trust us with your travel plans, we take that
                responsibility seriously. Real people helping real people. Beside you every step of the way.</p>  
                <br><br>
                <h2>Diversity Vision Statement</h2>
                <br><br>
               <p><span>Dream</span> Destination Travel Group is committed to improving diversity and inclusion within
                ourworkplace as we forge our path forward to create real, lasting change within our company. As a global
                leader in the travel industry, we also have the opportunity to help bring about change to the sector; we
                are committed to doing just that.</p> 
                <br><br>
              <p>We acknowledge that social injustice exists in the travel industry, and within the communities that
                our industry impacts. We place equality and equity at the top of our agenda. We will strive to do
                our part to eradicate the systemic discrimination of marginalized communities within the travel
                industry.</p>  
                <br><br>
             <p>Equal rights are central to the way we operate. We are an anti-racist company and stand with the
                communities who are discriminated against and facing continuous challenges to amplify their voices.
                We are committing ourselves to a better positive representation of black, indigenous and people of
                color and other racialized groups including, but not limited to, members of the LGBTQ2+ community,
                differently-abled and neurodiverse people. This started with the hiring of our first company
                Diversity Ambassador and will continue until racism and marginalization is eradicated, and we have
                achieved representation at all levels.</p>
